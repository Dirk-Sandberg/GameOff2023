Upgrades:
	monsters get stronger for each ally that dies near them
	Enemies from two sides with indicators about what's upcoming, allowing for strategic placement of troops
	monsters split upon death to next smallest size
	recruiting monsters takes longer for large scale, very fast for small scale
	offensive mode vs. stand ground mode
	increased damage based on nearby small allies
	increased damage based on nearby same-scale or NOT same-scale allies
	
	
Why does scale matter?
	Some enemies can only hit large units?
	Some enemies can only hit small units?
		-> Area of effect vs. high single target damage
		-> Minibosses that aoe chomp all your small units but have trouble versus big ones
		
todo:
	set limits of camera based on tilemap
	walk animations
	clicking on shop does something -> Use components in case switching structures
	shader for taking damage
	ally/enemy indicators -> Health bars
	scale basics
