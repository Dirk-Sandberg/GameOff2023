Why does scale matter?
	Some enemies can only hit large units?
	Some enemies can only hit small units?
		-> Area of effect vs. high single target damage
		-> Minibosses that aoe chomp all your small units but have trouble versus big ones
		
todo:
	set limits of camera based on tilemap
	walk animations
	clicking on shop does something -> Use components in case switching structures
	shader for taking damage
